Python Scopes and Namespace

Namespace in Python
In python namespace is a collection of names. Which holds as a mapping of every name, we have defined, to corresponding Objects.

Different namespace can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated.

A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we statr the python interpreter and exists as long we don't exit.

Modules can have various functions and classes. A local name space is created when a function is called, which has all the names defined in it.

# String can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no seperate character type; a character ia simply a string of one size:
word = 'Python'
word[0] # Character in position 0
# 'p'
word[5] # Character in position 5
# 'n'
# Indices many also be negative numbers, to satrt counting from the right:
word[-1] # last character
# 'n'
word[-2] # Second-last character
# 'o'
word[-6]
# 'p'
# [Note that -0 is same as 0, negative indices start from -1.]
